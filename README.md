## What is a FLUIDOS Node?

A FLUIDOS node is a Kubernetes cluster, orchestrated by a single control plane instance, and it can be composed of either a single machine (e.g., an embedded device) or a set of servers (e.g., a datacenter).
Device homogeneity is desired in order to simplify the management (physical servers can be considered all equals, since they feature a similar amount of hardware resources), but it is not requested within a FLUIDOS node. In other words, a FLUIDOS node corresponds to a *Kubernetes cluster*.

A FLUIDOS node handles problems such as orchestrating computing, storage, network resources and software services within the cluster and, thanks to [Liqo](https://liqo.io), can transparently access to resources and services that are running in another (remote) Kubernetes cluster (a.k.a. remote FLUIDOS node).
