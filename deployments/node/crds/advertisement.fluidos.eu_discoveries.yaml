                          continue may be set if the user set a limit on the number of items returned, and indicates that
                          the server has more data available. The value is opaque and may be used to issue another request
                          to the endpoint that served this list to retrieve the next set of available objects. Continuing a
                          consistent list may not be possible if the server configuration has changed or more than a few

                          remaining items is unknown and the field will be left unset and omitted during serialization.
                          If the list is complete (either because it is not chunking or because this is the last chunk),
                          then there are no more remaining items and this field will be left unset and omitted during

                          Servers older than v1.15 do not set this field.
                          The intended use of the remainingItemCount is *estimating* the size of a collection. Clients
                          should not rely on the remainingItemCount to be set or to be exact.
